Hi,
I wanted to take a moment to let you know I am leaving StubHub due to my personal health issues. Today is my last working day in StubHub.
I have enjoyed my work here and I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with you. Thank you for the support, guidance, and encouragement you have provided me during my time at StubHub.
Please keep in touch: I can be reached at my personal mail address (bailing.zheng77@gmail.com) or WeChat (bailing_zheng) or LinkedIn (https://cn.linkedin.com/in/bailingzheng)
Thanks,
Bai-Ling
